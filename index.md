# Project 1 : SIEM Deployment & Security Monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel

This project enhanced my learning on log analysis, threat intelligence, and automated response pipelines within cloud environments. 

The project was implemented on Microsoft Azure, using Microsoft Sentinel as the SIEM tool. The key technical features were: Azure Virtual Machine Configuration: Configured a Windows Server VM to generate security events for analysis.

Log Ingestion & Analysis: Integrated Sentinel with Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) to ingest and analyze security logs. 

Custom Analytics Rules: Developed Kusto Query Language (KQL) scripts to detect security incidents.

Some of the challenges I faced were Log Data Overload: Sorting through critical security events from large data sets meant that KQL queries had to be optimized.

Rule Fine-Tuning: Tuning analytics rules to eliminate false positives without suppressing legitimate threats.

Automating Response Operations: Not hindering normal functioning but promptly resolving actual security issues.



# Custom analytics Rule that checks for successfull log ins.
Coded Custom analytics rules to detect and alert on potential security threats through the RDP.

Automated incident response mechanisms, reducing reaction time for suspected breaches.

Gained hands-on knowledge on Azure security utilities, log inspection, and SIEM functionalities.

# Brief project description

Cocktail Finder is an interactive web application that allows users to discover cocktail recipes based on their interests. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project uses an external API to fetch and display real-time cocktail data. The app has a clean and responsive design that offers a seamless experience across any device. The project shows my ability to build interactive web applications, use APIs, and craft user-friendly experiences
